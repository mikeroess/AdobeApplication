<!-- TODO: didn't you get some actual sponsorship for your wedding?  Also you got into the GBOWR.  I would think that is a "tell me more" enough experience that is related enough (man, this person really does know how to market, and in innovative ways too) to include? -->
### Marketing content you’ve written.
- At Lerner's Graphic Universe, I essentially wrote the marketing blog:
   -  [My Wordpress author tag on their site](https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/author/erinfinnegan/)
   -  [Some convention coverage for Lerner](https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/2010/04/28/mocca2010/)
   -  [Gathering coverage of a book's release](https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/early-praise-for-nolas-worlds/)

### Open source projects you’ve contributed to, or a write-up of your contributions to a closed source project that we can verify.
<!-- TODO: Project first.  Link to write up second.  I'm scanning this, and I'm not going to get past the first clause to be wowed by the grant funding -->
  - Here's a good write-up of [Twitch Plays Shakespeare](http://fromjia.com/projects/twitch/), funded by the Google Experiments in Storyteling Grant. I created and directed the project, collaborated on coding it, and hired Jia as the graphic designer. [Here's the code](https://github.com/futuremarc/Twitch-Plays-Hamlet).
  <!-- TODO: Nit -- unless you know that these guys are fans of DS, ITP, i'd keep the horn tooting adjectives (amazing) to your own stuff-->
  - Here's [my first ever pull request](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-S14/pull/1) , which I did in [Dan Shiffman's](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) amazing Nature of Code class at [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp):
  <!-- TODO: I wouldn't call these class projects?  No need to hide that they are, but there's a stigma involved in class related things
  So, maybe just talk about what each of these things are?  Then, in person, they'll ask why you did it, and you can say, oh it was for a class
  project-->
 - My final project in that class was written in javascript.
    - Here's [a code sample](https://github.com/ErinFinnegan/Omnomitron/blob/master/itallhappenshere.js)
    - Here's [a video of the code working](https://vimeo.com/100457165)
    <!-- TODO: a RESTful application that does (x) will stay in my brain more -->
- [Here's a RESTful application](https://github.com/kinasmith/isTheFloorFeeding/blob/master/heroku/public/index.html) that I collaborated on with a classmate (the page [still exists](http://isthefloorfeeding.herokuapp.com/) on heroku).
    - See the image below of the physical component of the project

### Existing Examples of Community Engagement or Marketing Outreach

<!-- I am scanning and want to know the what, but not the how.  You got paid to do this for 10 years, awesome!  -->
I spent 10 years as a journalist engaging with the anime and manga fan community. I got into it by [starting a podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ninja-consultant-podcast/id74941727?mt=2), and I met other podcasters who were anime magazine writers first and podcasters second; soon I started getting paid gigs reviewing anime and manga and writing convention coverage, for Publishers Weekly, Otaku USA Magazine, and AnimeNewsNetwork.com.

### Product launches you were involved in.
  - I wrote for Otaku USA from the 2nd issue on, so in the magazine's first year I was invited to sit on this panel, which I recorded for my podcast: [Otaku USA Magazine panel at New York Anime Festival 2008](http://ninjaconsultant.com/?m=200811)
  - [I interviewed the author of The Rough Guide to Anime](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/12974-an-anime-canon-for-all.html), as press for his book launch for Publishers Weekly.

### Forum/Stackoverflow/etc answers you’ve written.
<!-- I'd shy away from mentioning a place where you did something wrong in a post in the application material -->
- I spent three years writing for [Anime News Network](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/advertising), where part of my job as columnist was daily interaction with readers in the forum. In this example, I used insider jargon [incorrectly in a review](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2010-01-04#spice), causing [the forums to light up that week](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/bbs/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=126151).  You know it's going to be bad when the reaction post is:
   > Did you just call Horo a tsundere? To quote the great Inigo Montoya 'there will be blood tonight!' ...in the forum that is.
   <!-- TODO: THIS IS GOOD! The "I learned that a part of 'infomational content' is really 'marketing' and even as a critic you have to keep the content in line, to some extent, with audience expectations"  I feel like you are a person who does a job and thinks about it, learns, and improves in your ability to do it -->
- Fortunately I [liked season two better](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2011-09-26#spice), but I had to make peace with the readers:

  <!-- TODO: As a non anime person reading your application, I am lost and don't care. -->
   > You know, I learned a lot by reviewing Spice and Wolf season one. I learned never to use words like “furry” or “tsundere,” even if I think I know what those words mean. I learned that many readers consider “Rental Shelf” to be a pan (I disagree). I learned that anime fans love Spice and Wolf.

### Details on email campaigns you’ve driven.
<!-- TODO: I don't care about what inspired you -->
- In 2016 [I did this kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/432973105/puppet-vr-murder-mystery) for a personal project, the "Puppet VR Murder Mystery". I was inspired to pitch the project at the [NY Media Center's VR Pitchfest](http://nymediacenter.com/events/event/?id=46910F62-0543-4157-B569EF3C490345BE&slugid=virtual-reality-pitchfest), and chosen from hundreds of applicants to pitch to a Shark Tank of professionals.
<!-- TODO: you don't try and do things, you do them.  Highlight why this is important.  I don't know why using both of these is better than just emailing.  Maybe I used these things to ensure that every contact I'd ever made would be exposed to this (maybe more than once, and I timed things so I'd get the right engagement) -->
  - I used SurveyMonkey and GreenInbox to try and reach all my Gmail and Facebook contacts.
  <!-- TODO: YES! Re-order.  I did (x) to acommplish (y).  I might only read half of this, because I'm scanning, and In this order I only know that you know about email filtering.  If I read the other half, there's a good chance I know that you know abotu email filtering because why else would you do that -->
  - Realizing that SurveyMonkey emails get sorted into Gmail's "Promotions" tab, I used [a Gmail add-on script](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mail-merge-with-attachmen/nifmcbjailaccmombpjjpijjbfoicppp) to email 80 people per day.
  <!-- TODO: I don't care about your future plans, I care about whether you will be good for my company. -->
  - I plan on re-launching this campaign next March with a lower goal, using everything I've learned about Kickstarter so far.

<!-- TODO: SPELL recieved CORRECTLY  -->
- In 2016, I co-created an interactive theater piece called ["The Institute"](https://sharangbiswas.myportfolio.com/the-institute), which recieved a Google Experiments in Storytelling Grant.  In terms of the marketing campaign, I was in charge of [creating the Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/TheInstituteAtTheBrick/) during the performances.


###  Decks are also welcome.
<!-- TODO: why are you not giving me your best one first?!?!?!?!?!?!  As a rushed person reading this with little attention, I am furious that you would do this to me and think you must not know how important it is to order content for the readers ease and attention.  But, yeah, there is a lot that is good about this.  I think putting it second, and explaining that (as you do here) is good.  No one is going to click through to either of these anyway (MAYBE NOT TRUE, DON'T BE AS CYNICAL AS I AM.) -->
 - [Here is the second best presentation I've ever given](https://vimeo.com/30828018).  I cover 300+ slides in under an hour.
   - That panel represents eight years of learning, in a deep dive into manga, and Japanese culture. I went from zero to an expert in the subject in a handful of years.
 - I consider [my Master's thesis](https://vimeo.com/128758304) my best presentation, but I didn't spent as much time on it.
